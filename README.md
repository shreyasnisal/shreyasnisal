## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Shreyas][website]

### I work on creative applications of technology

- I'm a software engineer focusing on gameplay and engine systems. I've developed custom game engines and games in Unity and Unreal.
- [ReyEngine](https://github.com/shreyasnisal/ReyEngine) is my custom C++ game engine with several 2D, 3D and VR games developed in it.
- [ReyWebEngine](https://github.com/shreyasnisal/ReyWebEngine) is my custom JavaScript game engine which uses a WebGL rendering pipeline.
- I'm excited about Virtual Reality (VR) game development, with both engines supporting VR using OpenXR and WebXR.
- Also check out [ArchiLeapVR](https://github.com/shreyasnisal/ArchiLeapVR), a first-person VR platformer with an in-game level editor.
